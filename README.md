# Automation_register

This project is an automated registeration feature for codenbox automation lab, built using Java programming language and the Selenium & Cucumber library. The script is designed to automate the account registration process for a website by entering the necessary information, including 
  1. Email address 
  2. First name 
  3. Last name 
  4. Password
  5. Phone number
from excel sheet (Source File).

The script uses the WebDriver component of the Selenium library to navigate to the registration page and input the required data into the corresponding fields. Once all the necessary data has been entered, the script will simulate a click on the submit button to complete the registration process.

in addition to Cucumber library which is a popular tool used for automation testing, which allows for the creation and execution of high-level test cases in a human-readable format. The script incorporates the Cucumber BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) methodology, which improves the collaboration between the development and testing teams by aligning the test cases with business requirements and user expectations.

The automation test script incorporates a wide range of test cases to ensure that all possible scenarios are covered and that the registration process is fully functional. These test cases may include scenarios such as incorrect or missing data in the registration form, validation of email address format and password strength, length, and complexity.

Using Java, Selenium and Cucumber to build the automation script allows for the script to be highly customizable and extendable. This means that the script can be tailored to meet the specific needs and requirements of different websites and applications.

Overall, the automation test script will save time and effort by automating the account registration process, reducing the need for manual input and increasing the accuracy of the registration process.
